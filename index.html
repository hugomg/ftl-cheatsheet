    <p>This page summarizes all the events in <a href="https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html">FTL Advanced Edition</a>.
       I created it because I got tired of wading through slow wiki pages and unreadable XML data files,
       when I am trying to remember what a particular event does.
       Use Ctrl-F to find the event your are looking for, and have fun!
       <p>Note: Some events in the list may be test/debug events, which cannot be encountered via normal gameplay.

<div class="indent">
<ul class="textlist"><li>This sector was bustling with activity just a few years ago. Now, more than half of the jump beacons have been destroyed, many settlements have been abandoned and the Rebels patrol constantly.<li>This sector was hit hard by the rebellion. The many alien settlements and stations located here are now watched over by almost an equal number of Rebel bases, heavy-handedly &#x27;keeping the peace&#x27;.<li>Once the Federation forces were scattered, the Rebels came down hard on the locals here. Between the &#x27;tax collectors&#x27; and military bases, the Rebel presence in this sector is high.<li>At one point this was one of the most commonly traveled sectors. Knowing that, the Rebels have stationed a number of fleets here. Be careful.<li>You will have to be very cautious in this sector. The Rebels have full control and are no doubt looking for you.</ul>

You try to assume the air of a local as you prepare to dock.<li>You arrive at a small space station that is putting out wide-band broadcasts on black-market channels. You doubt they would turn away any business, regardless of allegiances.<li>You receive generic advertisements from a nearby public ship-yard.

Luckily, no one seems to be paying attention to small cruisers. No ships are scanning or messaging you.<li>You arrive near a small Rebel refueling depot. Your ship is being scanned multiple times so they must recognize you, but there appears to be no combat-ready ships in the vicinity. The only message you receive is a denial to your request to dock at the depot.<li>There is not much of interest nearby. A small sun in the distance with a few orbiting planets in nearby space provide little of interest.<li>There are no other ships near this beacon, however you detect a small communication relay. You tap into it without a problem; there is no encryption. Most of the chatter revolves around troop and fleet movements, not particularly interesting.<li>There is a small planet nearby with scattered settlements. A small Rebel fleet is in orbit with many ships ferrying back and forth. It must be a more recently &#x27;liberated&#x27; planet.</ul>

We&#x27;re getting out of this sector as soon as this Coolant Shaft is fixed and I suggest you do the same. I half expect those damn metal freaks to come and try to melt down our ship at any moment. We&#x27;re trying to offload some inventory - interested in buying something?&quot;<li>You arrive to discover a number of Lanius ships docked at what appears to be a station. You hasten to leave but are relieved when they message you in your language. &quot;Buy? Sell? Traders.&quot; Apparently some merchants emigrated with the scavengers.<li>A trading depot is set up near the beacon. A surprising number of military ships guard the station. You pick up an advertisement on a wide band channel, &quot;Ship parts, repairs, refueling, souvenirs - we got it all. Check out the only store not afraid of scavengers this side of Omacron 6.&quot;<li>You arrive at an empty space station, no doubt abandoned due to the Lanius threat. Life signatures are detected at the ship depot and you spot a few crude signs stating &quot;Everything Must Go!&quot;<li>This beacon is bustling with activity. It looks like some merchants decided to capitalize on the fact that dozens of refugee ships are using this location to recharge their FTL drives. You browse their wares.<li>You receive a message from a nearby station, &quot;The end is upon us! The metal demons have come to absorb your very being!

You have no way of knowing if the area was always uninhabited or if it was simply erased by the Lanius.<li>A few refugee ships are preparing for the long journey to another sector. They explain how a number of Lanius military ships surrounded them and began to hack their FTL drives. Fortunately the Lanius moved on after briefly scanning the civilian ships, leaving them more than a little shaken up.<li>You pass a civilian ship that warns of the nearby Lanius. &quot;One of them attacked a civilian transport and started to melt their fracking hull. But then the weirdest thing happened... another metal ship actually fired on its companion until it backed off.&quot; Apparently there are disagreements among the Lanius about what should be salvaged.<li>You question a local settlement and they describe a fleet of metal ships wordlessly collecting all of the abandoned metal and debris in the area. When they approached important satellites, the settlements fired a few ASB warning shots. The Lanius moved on despite clearly having the firepower to overwhelm the settlements.<li>You come across a human civilian ship preparing to leave the sector. They message you, &quot;We&#x27;re getting out of here! There was some cult rambling about the spreading of the disease, Humanitis. They forcefully boarded our ship and tried to open all of our airlocks, shouting, &quot;Be purged!&quot; Is nowhere safe anymore?&quot;<li>The charts indicate this was the location of a small skirmish over a military facility on a nearby moon.
